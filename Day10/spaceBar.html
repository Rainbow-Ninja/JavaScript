            2.1 - Even Milliseconds Spacebar
            The page should tell the user about this game & to press the spacebar.
            The game is this:
            The player has to thold down the spacebar to start the game.
            If they let go of the spacebar when the current time's milliseconds value is an even number, they win. If it's odd, they lose.
            While they hold down the spacebar, cycle through some messages. You could tease them or encourage them.
            While they hold down the spacebar, also show the current time with milliseconds visible. 
            When they let go of the spacebar, tell the user what the current time is & if they won or lost. -->
